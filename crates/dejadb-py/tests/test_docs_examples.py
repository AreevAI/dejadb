"""The documented "proof" blocks are executable, and their printed output is asserted.

Two bug reports against the same six lines were the same failure twice over:
#40 raised `STO-E001` where the docs showed a result, and the fix for it (a
duplicate add became a no-op) turned the crash into silence — the block ran
clean and printed nothing, which reads as "Deja Loop found no problems" (#66).
Both would have been caught here.

The scope is deliberately narrow: the Deja Loop proof blocks, the ones the
README introduces as "the fastest way to see it needs no agent". They are
extracted from the shipped Markdown rather than retyped, so a block that is
edited without being re-run fails instead of quietly drifting from the engine.
