//! `record_tool_call` records occurrences, not values (#66).
//!
//! Grains are content-addressed and `created_at` has millisecond resolution, so
//! byte-identical tool calls recorded inside one millisecond hash to a single
//! address — and since 1.1.1 a duplicate add is a silent no-op rather than an
//! error. That combination quietly deleted the flagship analyzer's input: an
//! agent retrying a failing call with identical arguments is exactly the
//! workload `loop.tool_failure` exists to catch, and five identical failures
//! collapsed to one grain with nothing left to cluster.
//!
//! These tests run the documented five-failure example through the real
//! binding path and assert the recommendation it is documented to produce.
//! They are deliberately timing-sensitive in the direction that matters: they
//! record with no sleep, which is what made the bug reproduce in release builds
//! (and hide in debug ones).
