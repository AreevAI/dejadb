# dejadb-bench — committed results

Machine-readable, auditable results from the `accuracy` benchmark. Each run is
two files:

- `*.summary.json` — config (reader/judge/embedder), overall answer accuracy,
  retrieval hit-rate, per-category breakdown.
- `*.transcripts.jsonl` — one row per question: `{category, category_name,
  correct, question, gold, answer, verdict}`. This is the raw evidence — every
  answer and every judge verdict — so the number can be independently audited
  (the category has a history of unreproducible claims; we publish the receipts).

## Runs — best configuration

| file stem | benchmark | reader / judge | embedder | k | answer acc | hit@10 / hit@20 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `locomo-gpt-4o-mini-k20-2026-07-07` | LoCoMo (1,982 QAs) | gpt-4o-mini / gpt-4o | text-embedding-3-small@512 | 20 | **54.2%** | **74.5% / 81.6%** |

Raw turns, real embeddings, k=20 — the winning config. (Explored and dropped
because they didn't help this benchmark: distilled-observation ingest, MMR /
rerank / query-expansion refinements, and a stronger gpt-4o reader — see
`../RESULTS.md` §4 for why the bottleneck is reader synthesis, not retrieval.)

## Methodology

Plain retrieve-then-read, no LoCoMo-specific tuning. Each conversation turn is
ingested as a grain; each question drives `recall_hybrid` for the top-20 turns;
the reader answers from those turns (session dates included so relative time
resolves to absolute dates — LoCoMo's temporal category requires this); an LLM
judge grades the answer against gold. hit@k counts a gold-evidence turn in the
top-k.

The number depends on the reader/judge models and retrieval quality, **not on
the store alone** — it is a full-pipeline number, published with its config and
transcripts. The LoCoMo answer key itself is ~6% wrong
([audit](https://dev.to/penfieldlabs)), so treat single-point comparisons across
vendors with suspicion.

## Reproduce

```bash
# 1. dataset
curl -sSL -o locomo10.json \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snap-research/locomo/main/data/locomo10.json

# 2. precompute real embeddings (or skip → TF-IDF floor, 40.7% hit@10)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
python3 crates/dejadb-bench/scripts/embed_locomo.py locomo10.json cache.json 512

# 3. run the best config (raw turns, k=20), logging transcripts
DEJADB_EMBED_CACHE=cache.json DEJADB_TOPK=20 DEJADB_LLM_DEBUG=1 \
DEJADB_LLM_CMD='python3 crates/dejadb-bench/scripts/openai_chat.py gpt-4o-mini' \
DEJADB_JUDGE_CMD='python3 crates/dejadb-bench/scripts/openai_chat.py gpt-4o' \
  cargo run --release -p dejadb-bench --bin accuracy -- locomo10.json 10 > run.log 2>&1

# 4. canonicalize into results/
python3 crates/dejadb-bench/scripts/parse_results.py \
  run.log crates/dejadb-bench/results/<stem> gpt-4o-mini gpt-4o \
  openai/text-embedding-3-small@512 <date>
```

Retrieval-only (no LLM, no key) is the same command minus `DEJADB_LLM_CMD`.
Full run cost/time on 1,982 QAs ≈ $0.85 / ~50 min. See `../RESULTS.md` for the
latency, trust, and honesty-metric benchmarks.
