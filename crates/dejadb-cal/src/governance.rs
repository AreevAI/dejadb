//! The governance seam (CAL 1.3 §8.16) — how loop lifecycle statements
//! reach the Deja Loop engine without `dejadb-cal` depending on it.
//!
//! `dejadb-cal` sits below `deja-loop` in the workspace, so the executor
//! cannot call the engine directly. Instead the host attaches a
//! [`GovernanceHost`] to [`crate::CalExecutorConfig`]; `dejadb-loop`
//! provides the real implementation over the same facade the executor is
//! executing against (passed per call — never a second store handle, which
//! the single-writer registry would refuse). No host attached →
//! governance statements return `Unsupported`, the crate's convention for
//! reachable-but-unbacked surface.
//!
//! Identity never rides the statement: the host derives actor, scopes, and
//! observer from the facade's bound session, so a query cannot claim to be
//! someone.
