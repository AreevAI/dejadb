# DejaDB Security Model & Threat Model

This document describes DejaDB's trust boundaries, what its defenses do and do
not protect against, and how to deploy it safely. It complements
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) (which covers vulnerability reporting).

> This model is written to be **honest about current
> limitations** rather than aspirational. Where a protection is partial or
> planned, it says so.

## What we are protecting

The asset is **agent memory** — often personal, long-lived, and sensitive
(conversations, facts about people, decisions, credentials an agent was told).
The primary goals are **confidentiality** (at rest and in transit) and
**integrity** (a grain cannot be silently altered).

## Trust model at a glance

DejaDB is an **embedded** engine, like SQLite. Its baseline trust boundary is
**the local process and the user who runs it**. Everything below is layered on
top of that.

| Surface | Transport | Trust boundary | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| Library (`dejadb-*` crates) | in-process | the host program | n/a |
| CLI (`deja`) | local process | the invoking user | filesystem perms |
| MCP server (`serve --mcp`) | stdio | the parent process that spawned it | inherited |
| Web console (`deja ui`) | HTTP/1.1 | **loopback only by default** | none, or `--token-env` (Basic/Bearer on every request) |
| Sync hub (`dejad`) | HTTP/1.1 | networked peers | bearer token (writes + sync) |

## Data at rest

- **Encryption at rest** is optional and off by default. When enabled, the
  memory database (grains, indexes, op-log, and WAL) is encrypted with
  **AES-256-GCM** via the underlying storage engine's page cipher.
- **Key derivation.** The CLI derives the 32-byte key from a passphrase using
  **Argon2id** (OWASP-recommended parameters: 19 MiB memory, 2 iterations).
  The non-secret salt and parameters live in a `<db>.kdf` sidecar created on
  first use. Applications embedding the library may instead supply a raw
  32-byte key directly.
- **Key handling.** Passphrases and derived keys are wrapped in `Zeroizing`
  buffers and wiped from DejaDB's memory after use. (The passphrase is read
  from an environment variable via `--passphrase-env`, never a command-line
  argument, so it does not leak into shell history or the process table.)
- **Crypto-erasure.** Because the key is never written to the file, destroying
  the passphrase (and the derived key) renders the data unrecoverable — a fast,
  durable delete of an entire encrypted memory.

### Known limitations at rest

- **The `.blobs` CAS sidecar is encrypted** when the memory is: AES-256-GCM
  under a key HKDF-derived from the page-cipher key (domain-separated, so a
  leaked blob key does not open the database), with the content address bound
  in as associated data. The `cas://sha256:` address stays the digest of the
  **plaintext** so addresses are stable across encrypted and plaintext stores
  — the documented cost is that a blob filename is a content-equality oracle
  (someone holding a candidate file can tell whether this memory stores it).
  ⚠️ Attachments written by a build from before this landed stay plaintext
  until migrated: run `deja blobs encrypt` and check `open_warnings()`.
- ⚠️ **The encryption feature depends on the storage engine's *experimental*
  AES-GCM implementation** (a pinned Turso dependency). Treat encryption at
  rest as **defense-in-depth**, not a replacement for full-disk encryption on
  the host.
- ⚠️ **Losing the `.kdf` sidecar** means the passphrase can no longer re-derive
  the key. Back the sidecar up alongside the database.

## Data in transit (sync & hub)

- Sync ships **bundles/segments** (`.mgb`) of immutable grains between files and
  peers. Applied grains are re-hashed on import; a grain whose content does not
  match its content address (SHA-256) is rejected.
- The **hub** (`dejad`, started with `deja hub --dir DIR --token-env VAR`)
  requires a **bearer token** on all mutating and segment endpoints — including
  `GET /api/segment*`, so listing and pulling bundles are gated too, not just
  pushes. The token is compared in **constant time**. Segment names are
  sanitized to a single path component (no directory traversal). `--token-env`
  is **mandatory** for `deja hub`: unlike the console there is no
  trusted-local-operator default, because a hub exists to be written to by other
  machines. A pushed segment is an **op-log replay**: it adds grains and
  applies tombstones — including erasure tombstones, which is how a subject's
  erasure reaches the hub's store (a tombstone deletes only the exact grain
  hash it names, and its sole-referenced CAS attachments; it can never delete
  by predicate).
- The **web console** (`deja ui`) is unauthenticated by default (loopback,
  trusted local operator). Pass `--token-env <VAR>` to require a shared secret
  on **every** request — the console page, all reads, and all writes. Browsers
  authenticate through the native HTTP **Basic** prompt (any username; password
  = the token); scripts may send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The token is
  compared in constant time, and a `401` carries `WWW-Authenticate: Basic` so
  browsers prompt. Naming an env var (not a flag) keeps the secret out of argv
  and shell history.
- Import is **DoS-hardened**: an untrusted `.mg` blob is size-capped and its
  msgpack framing is validated iteratively before decoding, so a hostile grain
  cannot cause a stack overflow (deep nesting) or a giant pre-allocation (a
  short header claiming a huge length).
- The HTTP server bounds per-connection bytes, caps header size/count, and sets
  read/write timeouts (slowloris mitigation).

### Known limitations in transit

- ⚠️ **No TLS.** All HTTP is plaintext. For any non-loopback deployment, front
  the console/hub with a **TLS-terminating reverse proxy**. Both `deja ui` and
  `deja hub` refuse to bind a non-loopback address unless you pass
  `--allow-remote` (and even then warn loudly). `--token-env` authentication
  is **not** a substitute for TLS: the token and all memory still cross the
  wire in the clear, so `--token-env` guards against unauthorized clients but
  not against a network eavesdropper — use it *with* a TLS proxy off-loopback.
- ⚠️ **Integrity, not authenticity.** Content addressing detects corruption and
  tampering, but does **not** verify *who* authored a grain. There is dormant
  scaffolding for COSE signing, but signature verification is not yet enforced
  on import. **Only sync with peers you trust.**
- ⚠️ **`verify` detects modification, not removal.** `deja verify` re-hashes
  every grain it can read, so an in-place edit of stored bytes is caught. But
  whole-file tampering that corrupts the WAL makes the storage engine roll the
  file back to its last consistent state — grains written since then silently
  vanish, and `verify` reports `ok` on the smaller, self-consistent survivor
  set. Truncation of a consistent store is indistinguishable from
  "never written" using the file alone; to detect it, compare against an
  **external anchor** — the op high-water mark of a `deja stream` segment
  directory, a bundle, or a hub replica.

## Input handling

- **CAL** (the query language) destroys only in **shaped** forms — by hash
  (`FORGET <hash>`), by identity (`FORGET SUBJECT "<id>"`), or by age
  (`PURGE OLDER THAN <n>d`) — **never by predicate**. Each is authorized by
  the session's `delete`/`erase` grant, requires a recorded BECAUSE (the
  bulk forms mandatorily), and writes a Tier-2 audit Observation naming a
  subject **fingerprint**, not the identity. The executor's
  `allow_destructive_ops` switch (default on; `--no-destructive-ops`) is a
  process-wide restrictive **cap** over any grant — use it for a read-only
  session, e.g. when serving untrusted input over MCP.
  `DELETE`/`ERASE`/`TRUNCATE`/… are not grammar tokens, `FORGET USER/SCOPE`
  are refused from text, and the server path requires the `admin` scope.
  `REPORT SUBJECT` — the read-only DSAR mirror — classifies as a read and is
  gated by `read`, deliberately not by the destructive cap. CAL is otherwise
  hardened against abuse (max query length, nesting depth, LET-binding and
  result-size caps, Unicode bidi-override rejection, NFC normalization).
- The store issues **parameterized SQL** exclusively; user strings are
  dictionary-encoded to integer term-ids before reaching the triple queries, so
  there is no SQL-injection surface.
- The **web console** escapes grain-controlled data before rendering it, so a
  synced grain carrying HTML/JS markup is inert in the UI.

## Threats in scope (please report)

- Memory-safety, panics, or resource exhaustion reachable from untrusted `.mg`
  blobs, bundles, or imported segments.
- Injection, path traversal, or auth bypass in CAL, the store, the MCP server,
  or the console/hub.
- Cryptographic weaknesses in the encryption or crypto-erasure paths.
- Secret or data leakage in error messages, logs, or `Debug` output.

## Threats out of scope

- An already-compromised host, physical access, or a malicious local process
  running with the same privileges as DejaDB.
- Whether a memory stores a *specific known* attachment: blob filenames are
  plaintext content addresses (see the sidecar note above).
- Network confidentiality without an operator-provided TLS proxy (by design).
- Forged grain provenance when syncing with an untrusted peer (integrity is
  guaranteed; authenticity is not, until signing lands).

## Deja Loop (self-improvement) trust boundary

Deja Loop lets an agent change its own memory, so its governance *is* a security
boundary. See [`loop.md`](loop.md) for the surfaces; the invariants:

- **Read-only token-less console (breaking change).** Token-less `deja ui` is
  read-only. Every write — any loop mutation, or an `ADD`/`SUPERSEDE`/
  `FORGET` CAL batch — returns 401 without `--token-env VAR`. This closes the
  bypass where a local process could execute a proposal's CAL directly and
  skip the review queue, which would void the whole governance story. The
  server classifies a POST `/api/cal` by its leading keyword and fails closed.
- **The trust floor is not configurable.** These fields do not exist in any
  file or policy schema (unknown keys are rejected at load), so a hostile or
  synced file can never arrive pre-armed: auto-apply never touches free text,
  destruction, prompts, or LLM-drafted content; analyzers execute read-only;
  no payload amplifies scopes; no file raises a host-set cap.
- **The laundering threat.** The deterministic path can carry attacker text:
  tool-failure clustering derives a signature from attacker-controlled tool
  output. So auto-apply is restricted to SUPERSEDE-only structural curation
  with **zero** attacker-influenced free text (an `ADD` disqualifies), and any
  recommendation introducing evidence-derived text is always approval-required
  with the untrusted prose shown as a literal, escaped diff.
- **Auto-apply is default-off and host-granted only.** It requires host opt-in
  plus a matching grant in the optional `loop-policy.json`, a built-in
  analyzer, a memory/query target, non-destructive payload, and an engine-side
  per-draft shape check. The policy file is host config, never persisted in a
  memory file, and rejects unknown keys — a stolen or committed policy file is
  inert (it cannot register an executable).
- **Separation of duties + accountable audit.** `write` grants neither
  `review` nor `apply`; self-approval is blocked against the creating actor;
  every transition writes an immutable, hash-chained audit Observation with a
  mandatory reason. Audit grains live and die with the file they govern —
  erasing a subject's file erases its audit (correct GDPR-shaped behavior).

## Roadmap

- Enforced grain signing / authenticity verification on import (COSE).
- First-class TLS for the hub.
